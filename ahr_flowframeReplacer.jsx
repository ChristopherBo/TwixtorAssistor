// This is a bonus addon script to my Twixtor Assistor extension.
// Given a folder of flowframes clips it places all of them in the
// precomps they were twixtored in and formats their respective precomps
// to the length and FPS of the flowframed clips.
//
// Prereq: The precomps you originally twixtored in must be in a folder
//         named Twixtor Precomps. If you used my Twixtor Assistor
//         extension, it should already exist with the precomps in it.
// Usage: Select the flowframe clips and run it.
